# CoordConv
The CoordConv solution for addressing the failure of convolutional neural networks in mapping between coordinates in (x,y) Cartesian space and one-hot pixel space.


This code has been implemented based on the following paper:
Liu, Rosanne, et al. "An intriguing failing of convolutional neural networks and the coordconv solution." Advances in neural information processing systems 31 (2018).
